function trials = extractTrials(stats,pokeHistory)
% trials = extractTrials(stats,pokeHistory)
% This function takes as its inputs: stats, pokeHistory
% And returns the matrix: trials
% 'trials' is a matrix where each row represents a decision poke in a
% succesful trial. It has 4 columns which contain the following
% information: 
    % 1: time
    % 2: port (1 = right, 2 = left)
    % 3: right port reward probability
    % 4: left port reward probability
    % 5: reward given (1 / 0)
%Note: extractTrials was changed on 08/03/16 to include the probabilities
%of both ports for each trial. Previously there was only 4 columns, with
%the 3rd being the reward probability of the port poked and the 4th the
%reward boolean. 

% create a vector 'timePoked' where each entry represents a poke, and the
% value is the number of seconds since the first poke. This is also
% calculated in pokeAnalysis_v1, but I wanted to add it here so this can
% stand as an independent function.

firstPoke = datevec(pokeHistory(1).timeStamp);

%% create trials matrix
%trials is going to be a numTrials by 4 matrix where the columns are as
%following:

    % 2: time since last trial
    % 3. time between trial initiation and decision
    % 4: port (1 = right, 2 = left)
    % 5: right port reward probability
    % 6: left port reward probability
    % 7: reward given (1 / 0)
    % 8: laser stim given (1 / 0)
